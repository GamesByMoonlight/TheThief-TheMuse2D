# TheThief-TheMuse2D
The thief and the muse work together to collect items and avoid gaurds.

A multi player platform couch co-op. You have to work together to collect gems and "coins" called Luckies and escape.
Everytime you collect all the Luckies (and potentially the final gem), you complete and move on to the next level. 

The Thief uses his agility to access unreachable areas and The Muse uses her powers to incapacitate guards so the duo cannot be caught. 

(Unfinished project...)
